Smart Tap

The Smart Tap is a modern solution designed to enable convenient, hygienic, and water-saving control of water flow. This project utilizes simple electronic components, including an Infrared Sensor, 1k Resistor, Zero PCB, and a DC Water Pump, to create a fully automated water tap that operates without physical contact. This makes it especially useful in bathrooms, kitchens, and other places where reducing the chance of spreading germs is a priority.

At the core of this Smart Tap is the Infrared Sensor, which detects the presence of a hand underneath the tap. This sensor emits infrared rays and then measures the reflection to determine if an object is close by. Whenever someone places their hand in range, the sensor detects this reflection and signals the control circuit to activate the water flow. This helps avoid unnecessary water waste, as water is turned on only when needed and off when the hand moves away.

The 1k resistor is used to limit the current flow and protect the Infrared Sensor and other components from damage due to excess current. It helps keep the electronic signals stable and reliable during operation.

The Zero Printed Circuit Board (PCB) serves as a base for assembling all the components in a compact and organized manner. All the components—the Infrared Sensor, resistor, and the control circuit for the Water Pump—can be neatly placed and connected on this board. This results in a reliable, cost-effective, and space-saving design.

The DC Water Pump is a small yet powerful pump that controls the flow of water. When the Infrared Sensor signals its output, it drives the Water Pump, turning it on and allowing water to flow through the tap. Once the sensor no longer detects a hand, the Water Pump turns off, conserving water.

This Smart Tap is an ideal solution for conserving water, reducing the spreading of germs, and adding a convenient, automated control to a traditional water tap. It can be used in bathrooms, kitchens, hospitals, restaurants, or even schools, making daily routines more hygienic and efficient. Furthermore, its low-cost components make it accessible for both beginners and advanced electronic hobbyists. The Smart Tap is a perfect blend of technology, functionality, and sustainability, delivering a smarter way to manage water usage in our homes and workplaces.
